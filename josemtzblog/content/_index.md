# **Welcome** 

Jose holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science, has over six years of academic writing experience, and has published research papers in peer-reviewed international journals of software engineering. His technical background enables him to understand the technology stack of projects and make complex concepts understandable for the intended audiences.

Jose’s career has been divided into three major areas:
 * Technical Writer
 * Computer Science Researcher
 * University Teacher

He has experience working with multidisciplinary development teams to produce client-facing documentation, onboarding, and user guides. As a technical writer, he’s had the opportunity to publish the documentation with a range of tools such as: 
  - Confluence-based information hubs
  - Developer portals
  - API references
  - GitHub Documentation using docs as code graphic tools 

As a researcher, he has been working with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and knowledge representation to support software development environments and the reduction of knowledge vaporization in Agile Methodologies.

Finally, as a teacher, he worked in the classroom giving lectures, creating teaching material, mentoring, and workshops on API Design and Development, Software Design, and Requirement Analysis.
