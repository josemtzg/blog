# **Welcome** 


Jose holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science, has over six years of academic writing experience, and has published in peer-reviewed international journals. His technical background enables him to dive deep into the tech stack of projects to make complex concepts more understandable for multiple audiences. 

Jose's career has been divided into three major areas:

 * Technical writer
 * Computer Science Researcher 
 * University teacher

His technical writing ranges from Confluence-based information hubs to developer portals to API references and GitHub Documentation using docs as code graphic tools. Has experience working with multidisciplinary development teams to produce client-facing documentation, onboarding, and user guides.

As a researcher, he has been working with Artificial Intelligence and knowledge representation to support software development environment and the reduction of knowledge vaporization in Agile Methodologies.

Finally, as a teacher, he works in the classroom giving lectures, mentoring, and workshops on API design and development, Software Design, and Requirement Analysis.
